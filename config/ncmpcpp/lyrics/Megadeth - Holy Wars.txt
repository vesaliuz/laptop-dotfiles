Brother will kill brother, spilling blood across the land
Killing for religion, something I don't understand
Fools like me, who cross the sea and come to foreign lands
Ask the sheep, for their beliefs, do you kill on God's command?

A country that's divided, surely will not stand
My past erased, no more disgrace, no foolish naive stand
The end is near, it's crystal clear, part of the master plan
Don't look now to Israel, it might be your homelands
Holy wars

Upon my podium, as the know-it-all scholar
Down in my seat of judgment, gavel's bang, uphold the law
Up on my soapbox, a leader out to change the world
Down in my pulpit as the holier-than-thou could-be messenger of God

Wage the war on organized crime
Sneak attacks, rappel down the rocks, behind the lines
Some people risk to employ me
Some people live to destroy me
Either way they die
They die

They killed my wife and my baby with hopes to enslave me
First mistake, last mistake
Paid by the alliance to slay all the giants
Next mistake, no more mistakes

Fill the cracks in with judicial granite
Because I don't say it don't mean I ain't thinkin' it
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
I know what I said, now I must scream of the overdose
And the lack of mercy killings, mercy killings
Mercy killings, killings, killings, killings
Next thing you know, they'll take my thoughts away
