I don't feel a thing
And I stopped remembering
The days are just like moments turned to hours

Mother used to say
If you want you'll find a way
but mother never danced through fire shower

Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Is it right or is it wrong
and is it here that I belong

I don't hear a sound
Silent faces on the ground
the quiet screams, but I refused to listen

If there is a hell
I'm sure this is how it smells
I wish this were a dream, but no, it isn't

Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Am I right or am I wrong
and is it here that I belong

Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Why do I feel so alone
for some reason I think I'm home
