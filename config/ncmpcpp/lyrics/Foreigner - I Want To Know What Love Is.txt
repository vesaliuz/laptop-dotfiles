I've gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I'd better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older
Ohhh

Now this mountain I must climb
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
Up through the clouds I see love shine
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Oh, oh, ooh

I'm gonna take a little time
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
(And I wanna feel) I wanna feel what love is
(I know) I know you can show me

(Let's talk about love) I wanna know what love is
(Love that you feel inside) I want you to show me
(And I'm feeling so much love) I wanna feel what love is
(Oh, you just can't hide) I know you can show me
Oh, oh

I wanna know what love is
(Let's talk about love) I want you to show me
(I wanna feel it) I wanna feel what love is (I wanna feel it, too)
(And I know, and I know) I know you can show me
Show me that it's real, yeah
Yeah, yeah

I wanna know what love is (I wanna know, oh, oh)
I want you to show me (I wanna know, I wanna know, I wanna know)
I want to feel what love is (I wanna feel)
I know you can show me
