[Hook - Ludacris(Big K.R.I.T.):]
6 fifteens, candy coated riding clean
Every time I pull out a new whip I cause a scene
Rolling through my hood, I told 'em pimpin' ain't that easy
So whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
(Come and see me) Come and see me
Whatever you need, little buddy, come and see me

[Verse 1 - Ludacris:]
I'm talking Monte Carlos, Crown Vics, Cadillacs and Regals
If I get pulled over, everything I got's illegal
But I ain't got no worries I got Jesus riding shotgun
Knowing that I need a meal ticket and I can't stop until I got one
[Big K.R.I.T.:]
Shit, I'm whippin' cutty bubble bucket busty, bitches love to ride too
Hanging out the window front and central serving niggas like a late-night Wendy's drive through
Tweeters, speakers, jeekers fiendin', diamond in the back my nigga
I got two white girls, think I oughta have a curl in return of the mack, my nigga
[Ludacris:]
It's the return of the 'Lac
Riding on so many horses they think I'm playing polo
Candy paint drippin' like a Jheri curl, nigga, I'mma let my soul glo
Fleet, flickin', screaming, bitches, pitchin', counter, past fate
And all of the women get jealous cause of the way my car can make its ass shake
[Big K.R.I.T.:]
Last to base, in the face
The law's right beside me, my window tint, dawg
My rims are too large
As soon as I hit the back road bet the law can't find me
Ridin', candy paint with two poles in the trunk
Popped up twice with two hoes in the trunk
Disturb your peace with fifteens that thump
Duck my slab get sawed off with the pump

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big K.R.I.T.:]
I got two floors in my trunk, club lights in my trunk
I charge at the door them hoes hit the floor, we have club nights in my trunk
Cause it's an earthquake when I park, I keep a UFO in my yard
My wheels so big when I swing my whip I can high five God, lord
[Ludacris:]
I could skydive off of the top of the roof, rims taller than King Kong
Riding around looking for an ass that I could sit my drink on
My seats warm, my drink cold, my paint dry, but her mouth wet
Suffocate that ho till that bitch look like Smurfette
[Big K.R.I.T.:]
007 pressin' more buttons, I got all these gadgets, ho
I got all these alpine, it could turn a square chick ratchet, ho
Neon lights shine neon bright that I could direct all this traffic, ho
Young and wise my 9 to 5 would be a vortex if I crash it, ho
[Ludacris:]
Like a head on collision with a red bone mouth colder than Michigan
Reach in that glove box and I got more rubbers than Michelin
I'm feeling like Yao Ming in the whip (why?) I need more leg room
So I hit a switch and the whole back seat turned into a god damn bedroom

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Ludacris(Big K.R.I.T.):]
Okay now, ho, pour out that drinking watch me fire up that blunt
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
(Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk)
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
[Big K.R.I.T.(Ludacris):]
Okay, now bow down when you see me, don't be trippin' on the thump
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
(Don't make you pop your fuckin' trunk)
Don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Anybody getting outta line don't make me pop my fuckin' trunk
Hold up
