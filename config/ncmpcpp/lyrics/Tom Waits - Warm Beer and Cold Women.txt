One of those nights

It's warm beer and cold women
No, I just don't fit in
'Cause every joint I stumbled into tonight
That's just how it's been

All these double knit strangers
With gin and vermouth
And the recycled stories
In the Naugahyde booths

And the platinum blondes
And tobacco brunettes
I just be drinkin' to forget you
I light another cigarette

And the band's playin' something
By Tammy Wynette
And the drinks are on me tonight

All my conversations, now
I just be talkin' about you, baby
I'm boring some sailor
As I try to get through

I just want him to listen, now
I said that's all you have to do
He said I'm better off without you
Until I showed him my tattoo

And now the moon's rising
Ain't no time to lose
It's time to get down to drinking
Tell the band to play the blues

And the drink's are on me
I buy a couple rounds
At the last ditch attempt saloon

Warm beer and cold women
No, I just don't fit in
Every joint I stumbled into tonight
That's just how it's been

All these double knit strangers
With gin and vermouth
Receding hairlines
In the Naugahyde booths

And the platinum blondes
Tobacco brunettes
I just be drinking to forget you, baby
I light a menthol cigarette

And the band's playing somethin'
by Johnnie Burnette
At the last ditch attempt saloon
