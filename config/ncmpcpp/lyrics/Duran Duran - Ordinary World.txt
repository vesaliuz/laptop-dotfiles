Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radioStill I can't escape the ghost of you

What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize? (Gone away)

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Passion or coincidence once prompted you to say
"Pride will tear us both apart"
Well, now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops, run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart

What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most? (Gone away)

But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ahh-ah-ahh
Away-ay, ay-ay-ay-ay
Oh, oh

Papers in the roadside tell of suffering and greed
Fear today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh-ooh
Here besides the news of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk

And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive

(Every world is my world)
I will learn to survive
(Any world is my world)
I will learn to survive
(Any world is my world)
(Every world is my world)
