Baby, I just don't get it
Do you enjoy being hurt?
I know you smelled the perfume
The make-up on his shirt
You don't believe his stories
You know that they're all lies
Bad as you are, you stick around
And I just don't know why

If I was your man, baby, you'd
Never worry 'bout what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just wanna show you, you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you, mmh

Your true beauty's description
Look so good that it hurts
You're a dime plus 99
And it's a shame, you don't even know what you're worth
Everywhere you go, they stop and stare
'Cause you're bad and it shows
From your head to your toes, out of control
Baby, you know

Baby, you'd
Never worry 'bout what I do
I'd be coming home back to you
Every night, doing you right
You're the type of woman deserves good things
Fistful of diamonds, hand full of rings
Baby, you're a star
I just wanna show you, you are

You should let me love you
Let me be the one to
Give you everything you want and need
Baby, good love and protection
Make me your selection
Show you the way love's supposed to be
Baby, you should let me love you, love you, love you
Love you, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
