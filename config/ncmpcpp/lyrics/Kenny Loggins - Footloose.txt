Been workin' so hard
I'm punchin' my card
Eight hours, for what?
Oh, tell me what I've got

I got this feeling
That time's just holding me down
I'll hit the ceiling
Or else I'll tear up this town

Tonight I gotta cut loose
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

You're playin' so cool
Obeyin' every rule
But dig way down in your heart
You're burnin', yearnin' for some

Somebody to tell you
That life ain't passing you by
I'm trying to tell you
It will if you don't even try

You can fly if you'd only cut loose
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Ooh-ee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me
Whoa, Milo, come on, come on let's go
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah
(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah
(Yo-o-o-o-o)
Cut footloose-ah

First, we've got to turn you around
Second, and put your feet on the ground
Third, now take a hold of your soul
Ba, ba, ba
Ba!

I'm turnin' it loose!
Footloose, kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose

(Footloose) Footloose (footloose), kick off your Sunday shoes
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees
Jack, get back, come on before we crack
Lose your blues
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody cut, everybody cut
Everybody, everybody cut footloose!
