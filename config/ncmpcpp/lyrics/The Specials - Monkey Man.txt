I was on my way to Banbury Cross
Then I see a monkey upon a white horse
With rings on he fingers, bells on him toes
Sing a little song, wherever he be
'Cause he's a monkey, 'cause he's a monkey
'Cause he's a weedy little monkey man

Aye aye aye, aye aye aye!
Tell you baby
You huggin up the big monkey man
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye!
Tell you baby
You huggin up the big monkey man
