Stray, stray!

In the cold breeze that I walk along
The memories of generations burn within me
Been forever, since I've cried the pain the sorrow
I'll live and die, pride of my people gaining

I'm here standing on the edge
And staring up at where the moon should be
Ooh

Stray,
No regret 'cause I've got nothing to lose
Ever stray,
So I'm gonna live my life as I choose
Until I fall

Stray, stray
Stray, stray...

In the white freeze, never spoke of tears
Or opened up to anyone including myself
I would like to
Find a way to open to you
Been a while, don't know if I remember how to

I'm here waiting on the edge
Would I be all right showing myself to you
It's always been so hard to do

Stray,
No regret 'cause I've got nothing to lose
Ever stray,
So I'm gonna live my life as I choose
Until I fall

Stray, stray
Stray, stray
Stray, stray...

Is there a place waiting for me?
Somewhere that I belong
Or will I always live this way?

Always stray,
No regret 'cause I've got nothing to lose
Ever stray,
So I'm gonna live my life as I choose
'Cause all things fall

Stray, stray
Stray, stray
Stray, stray...

(That I walk alone)

(I'm here standing on the edge)
