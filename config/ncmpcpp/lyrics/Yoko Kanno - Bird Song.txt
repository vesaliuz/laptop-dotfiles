[Giggs & Swizz Beatz:]
I wanna see everybody stand 'til they feet up right now
I wanna see everybody stand on they feet right now
Ha!
Yeah
Zone, zone, zone, zone
(Hey Swizz, I'm just gonna rap from the top)
Make 'em stand up, ah

[Giggs:]
Exterminator, manager's observin' hater
All the man a terminator
Rollin' in a convertible 'til early, day up
Watch a couple videos and burn the day up
On my early bird to get that early paper
Yeah, we burnin' weed, no we ain't burnin' vapor
When we gettin' greasy, just a verbal taster
Rollin' up the weed, I got that herbal chaser
Yeah, got you up in your seat
Fuck them niggas 'cause all them motherfuckers is sheep
Get up, Swizzy, and show you motherfuckers a beat
I'm just happy 'cause my life I was stuck in the street
Yeah, 'cause it's nice 'cause none of this was up in my reach
Get to runnin' up 'cause that motherfucker was steep
Take a cigarette, brother, take a couple of sheets
If there's some in there, you can take the money for keeps
Yeah, they thought that they had it
I don't even know why they even thought they could have it
This my habitat when I'm bringin' forces of habit
Little cabbage patch, liftin' up the cork then I splash it
Yeah, just look at that, thinkin' I put off with a hatchet
When that mack attack, bet there won't be two when I clap him
That was random but that's just how I talk when I'm rappin'
Put all them cameras up 'cause in Hollywood they be snappin'

[Swizz Beatz:]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
That's too much, Hollow Man
That's too much, Hollow Man
You talkin' too crazy for 'em, huh
Tell 'em somethin'

[Giggs:]
Sneeze, nigga, then you lose
Man just got the weed, but we need the booze
Cinderella dreams, but don't need the shoes
We don't got degrees, but we livin' huge
Niggas 'bout to sweep, yeah, we need the brooms
You can leave the streets, but don't leave your goons
Niggas movin' booze, you're just movin' boos
You wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for dude
How is he, pop-pop? He ain't got no clues
Think he saw a ghost, Ebenezer Scrooge
They ain't in the mood, you ain't got the moves
You ain't got the hits, you ain't got the tunes
Mans have written them off
I don't listen to none of them niggas that's soft
Now they're questionin' if Hollow Man is still on the top
Why you runnin' 'round with Hollow Man? Just chill in the box
Outside, villainous fucks
One time real as the clock
Fugees, they think they're killin' me soft
Leakin' got me spillin' Courvois'
They don't see us, either
Came back, man, hit 'em with the meat cleaver
You a boss actin' like a diva
Bitch, fuck your money, dog, we don't need ya
Yeah, come through with the two on two
Outside white, inside, turquoise, too
Bangin' on your chest, oh, you think you come from the zoo?
I'ma pull up and show you what gorillas will do
Yeah, straight from New York to Peckham
Niggas actin' thirsty, pull up with the soaker and wet 'em

[Giggs & Swizz Beatz:]
Ayo, Giggs
I could go for another 50 or 60 bars but the song was over before I even got on this thing, huh
Zone, zone, zone, zone
Landlord
Showtime
Zone
Ayy
Right
Ayy
Right
What they gon' do now?
What they gon' do now, huh?
Ayy
Man I brought the BBC orchestra out to London just for no reason
