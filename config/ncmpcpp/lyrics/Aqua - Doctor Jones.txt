Sometimes, the feeling is right,
You fall in love for the first time
Heartbeat, and kisses so sweet,
Summertime love in the moonlight.

Aye yippey aye ooh
Aye yippey aye yeah
Aye yippey aye ooh wah

Now that summer is gone, you have to go back home.
Please come and see me again, I never felt more alone.
Baby, I'm missing you
I want you by my side.
And I hope you miss me too
Come back and stay.
I think about you every day
I really want you too.
You swept my feet right off the ground, you're the love I found.
