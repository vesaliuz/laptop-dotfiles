She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round

She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful who you love
Be careful what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Don't think twice! (hoo)

She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby crying, his eyes were like mine (oh no)
So we danced on the floor in the round, baby

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
But she came and stood right by me
And just smell the sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room

Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son

She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one (You know what you did)
She says he is my son (Breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one

Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is... (Don't call me, Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is...
