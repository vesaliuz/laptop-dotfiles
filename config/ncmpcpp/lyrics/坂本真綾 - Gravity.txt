Been a long road to follow
Been there and gone tomorrow
Without saying goodbye to yesterdayAre the memories I hold still valid?
Or have the tears deluded them?
Maybe this time tomorrow
The rain will cease to follow
And the mist will fade into one more today
Something somewhere out there keeps calling
Am I going home?
Will I hear someone singing solace to the silent moon?
Zero gravity whatâ€²s it like?
(Am I alone?)
Is somebody there beyond these heavy aching feet?
Still the road keeps on telling me to go on
Something is pulling me
I feel the gravity of it all
