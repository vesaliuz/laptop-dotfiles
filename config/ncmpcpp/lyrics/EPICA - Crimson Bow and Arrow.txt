Nos rapti sumus aut tamen raptores?

On to battle
Here we are the hunters
Red as fire
Crimson Bow and Arrow

Waiting for the storm won't help you
Just the will to fight can change you
Clean your weapons blow the dust off
Fear and prayers will never save us

We can't hide our pride behind fear
We will not let them be this near
In the end our strength unites us
Just the will to fight will save us

No, we will never ever fail
We stand up and we fight for the moment of the truth
Stand up and fight for their demise
We won't surrender

Day and night dividing the legions
Ignorance will show its weakness
Lasting peace an abandoned illusion
Blinded by trust in a twilight zone
Day and night disguising their secrets
Ignorance will kill the fearless
Offerings of reckless courage
Freedom for us all

On to battle
Here we are the hunters
Red as fire
Fear the bow

The humility of imprisonment
Fight with Crimson Bow and Arrow
Far away from the solemn castle walls
JÃ¤ger hunts his prey to death now
Diving into the instincts of the night
Red is piercing through the twilight
Soldiers with their wings of freedom will attack
Free the unrelenting slaves
Right now!

Not knowing the names of our
Broken trees and the trampled flowers
The fallen bird awaits the breeze
No one will guide you

Everlasting calm of the herds
It is but a vast illusion
Failing freedom of our dying wolves
Marks the era of confusion

Praying won't help
Fight for your land

Freedom and our way of life
These are but a vast illusion
When the darkness hits our crying wolves
It marks the era of conclusion

Those who only complain about their helplessness will not change a thing
The boy will pick up the black sword
Hate and anger are a two-edged blade
And soon it will show its teeth

All that ends this brutal game is not the weapon nor the skill
Reach out for the desire and awaken your will to kill
Go and free your mind, immerse yourself in unstoppable killer instinct
Bring back the hope, illuminate the darkness

Stand up and fight for their demise
We won't surrender now
Enthrone the devil in disguise
You can't defend her

Day and night dividing the legions
Ignorance will show its weakness
Lasting peace an abandoned illusion
Blinded by trust in a twilight zone
Day and night disguising their secrets
Ignorance will kill the fearless
Offerings of reckless courage
Freedom for us all

On to battle
Here we are the hunters
Red as fire
Crimson Bow and Arrow
On to battle
Here we die as heroes
Red as fire
Hearts will bleed to death
