If I could have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?
Stop to warm at karma's burning
Or look ahead, but keep on turning?

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Could I have my wasted days back
Would I use them to get back on track?

You live it or lie it
You live it or lie it
(You live it or lie it)

I've worn out always being afraid 
An endless stream of fear that I've made
Treading water full of worry
This frantic tick, tick tock of hurry

Do I have the strength
To know how I'll go?
Can I find it inside
To deal with what I shouldn't know?

Worn out, always being afraid
An endless stream of fear that I've made

You live it or lie it

Oh, my lifestyle (birth is pain)
Determines my death style
A rising tide (life is pain)
That pushes to the other side

My lifestyle (death is pain)
Determines my death style
A rising tide (it's all the same)
That pushes to the other side
