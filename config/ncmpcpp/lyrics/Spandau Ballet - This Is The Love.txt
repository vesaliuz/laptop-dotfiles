This is the love
This is the love
I was miles away
Lost within another day
Stepping out with feet of clay to get by
Couldn't buy more time
Couldn't even spin a dime
And the world went all sublime
You went by
This is the love
This is the love
This is the love
This is the love

I was waiting on a train
That would have come again
Then you passed like summer rain
Now this is the love

These streets were all I knew
Couldn't find a map to you
No one could tell me what to do
I was right
These walls we build will hide
Somehow you could touch the sky
You torn the roof right off the line
Now we fly
This is the love
This is the love
This is the love
This is the love

I was working on a scheme
To build a warm??
Now I'm looking at a dream
This is the love

When the lights turning blue
And the radio's off
There are songs in my head
And the frequence is strong
When time runs away
And the days don't seem long
You know that you fell
We want to belong
Sing your song

I was waiting on a train
That would have come again
Then you passed like summer rain
Now this is the love
This is the love
This is the love
This is the love
This is the love

When the lights turning blue
And the radio's off
There are songs in my head
And the frequence is strong

When the lights turning blue
And the radio's off
There are songs in my head
And the frequence is strong

When the lights turning blue
And the radio's off
There are songs in my head
And the frequence is strong
