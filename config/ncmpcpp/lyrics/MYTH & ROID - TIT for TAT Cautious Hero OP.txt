We’re shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
In the face of adversity, let us wait for our time, we'll go

Hey, if you wanna win, you've gotta play it smart
Nothing left to chance, the wise will take it all
Inundated with negative thoughts. Mood swayed by dark clouds

We've enduring for long enough

We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Now is the time to unleash the crystallization of our efforts
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
In times of glorious change, let us decide our fate, we'll go

I know I'm not alone, 'cause anybody knows
Patience is the key for those who will prevail
Read the tides and raise a flag. Souls raging in resonance

Piercing the heavens above

We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Now is the time to manifest our buring ardour
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Get to the answer in this upheaval and claim our future, we'll go

We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Are you listening? "We won't stop" A long concealed urge
Hear the voices, "Time has come" A signal gun to turn the tables
Are you listening? "We won't stop" An accomplishment of firm resolve
Hear the voices, "Time has come, we gotta go"

We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Now is the time to unleash the fruits of our labor
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
For the glory, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
In times of glorious change, let us decide our fate, we'll go

We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
We're shouting, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
