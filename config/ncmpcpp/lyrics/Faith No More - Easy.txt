I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain
Girl, I'm leaving you tomorrow
Seems to me girl, you know I've done all I can
You see I begged, stole and I borrowed
Yeah, ooh

That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning

I wanna be high, so high
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right
I wanna be free, just me
Oh baby
Ooh

Oh, ooh
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning, yeah yeah
That's why I'm easy
I'm easy like Sunday morning
