Sleepin' very soundly on a Saturday mornin'
I was dreamin' I was Al Capone
Rumors goin' 'round, gotta' clear outta' town
Smellin' like a dry fish bone

Here come the law, gonna' break down the door
Carry me away once more
Never, never, never want it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, yo

Rainy afternoon, oughta' kill a typhoon
And she's playin' on my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, yo
Hey

Walking down the street, shootin' people that I meet
Fully loaded Tommy gun
Here come the deputy, try fucking gettin' me
Gotta fucking get up and run

They got the sirens loose
I run right out of juice
They're gonna put me in a cell
If I can't go to Heaven, let me go to Hell

Crazy
Stone cold crazy, yo
Yeah
