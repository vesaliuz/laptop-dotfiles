The day begins riding a rainbow
Bow in her hand to drive away
The night again nothing has changed

And all around people are waking
King of them all has gone to rest
He passed the test leaving the stage

Time goes sailing on, slowly the crowd will appear
And into their ears the song they'd love to sing forever
Tomorrows come, tonight lives on for years

The time has come, follow the spotlight
Lighting the scene another world
The flags unfurled into the sky

And in the air music is playing
Ingots of gold fall to the ground
Creating sound into the night

Time goes sailing on, into the light disappears
And still in the ears, the song they'd love to sing forever
Tomorrows come, tonight lives on for years

Under a setting sun, spiriting shadows away
Wonderous people run, watch as the band start to play

The song they'd love to sing forever
The song they'd love to sing forever, forever
