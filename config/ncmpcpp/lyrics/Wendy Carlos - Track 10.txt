This is a new composition which features a random assortment of all living creatures. You'll find that it's not quite exactly the same as the one by Camille Saint, what's-his-name. Camille, in his research, was slightly behind, and I guess that some critters just plain slipped his mind. So to fill in this void in the Animal Kingdom I'll read some new verses. I'm not gonna sing them

So kindly shut up and I'll narrate for you "Carnival of the Animals: Part Two."
