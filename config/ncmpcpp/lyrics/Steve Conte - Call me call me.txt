I close my eyes and I keep seeing things:
Rainbow waterfalls,
Sunny liquid dreams.
Confusion creeps inside me rainin' down;
Got to get to you,
But I don't know how.

Call me, call me,
Let me know it's all right.
Call me, call me,
Don'cha think it's 'bout time?

Please won't you call and...

Ease my mind?
Reasons... for me to find you.
Peace of mind
What can I do...
...To get me to you?

I had your number quite some time ago,
Back when we were young,
But I had to go.
Ten thousand years I've searched it seems and now,
Got to get to you,
Won't you tell me how?

Call me, call me,
Let me know you are there.
Call me, call me,
I wanna know you still care.

C'mon now won't you...

Ease my mind?
Reasons for me to find you
Peace of mind
What can I do...
...To get me to you?

C'mon now won't you...

Ease my mind?
REASONS FOR ME TO FIND YOU (For me to find...)
PEACE OF MIND (Ease...)
Reasons... for living my life.

Ease my mind...
Reasons... for me to know you.
Peace of mind
What can I do...
...To get me to you?
