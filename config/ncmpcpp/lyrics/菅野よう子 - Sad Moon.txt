The singing sea
The talking trees
Are silent in a noisy way

The stars are bright
But give no light
The world spins backwards everyday
(Hey, look at that)

A rainbow rat
A checkered cat
Go tail in tail along the road

The mouse is pleased
The moon is cheese
The sun is shining hot and cold

A golden bird
Today I heard
Sitting upon a silver branch

His little song
Was very long
Which made me sad and start to laugh
(Ooh, let me see)

My sister's he
My brother's she
But there is only me in the family

When I grow up
Oh, I'll go down
The river to that singing sea
(Mm-hmm)
