[Verse 1: Barry Johnson]
I want to go together
Together like a barking dog with you
'Cause I stay home all day
Afraid to live my life
Maybe tomorrow
I'll want to do something else
'Cause I'll be feeling better
Much better in a half-lit moon with you
I don't know what to say
To say to save my life
Waiting to follow
I can't control myself

[Chorus: Barry Johnson & Nate Ruess]
Like old times fading away from me
Angel in the snow
How come nothing amazes me?
I don't know

[Verse 2: Barry Johnson]
I bet it's gone forever
Burned up in a fireball
The glue has melted all away
The world just falls apart
Pain leads to sorrow
And sorrow leads me back to how

[Chorus: Barry Johnson & Nate Ruess]
Like old times fading away from me
Angel in the snow
How come nothing amazes me?
I don't know

[Bridge: Barry Johnson]
It must be something out of nothing
Makes you think you're in a nightclub
Paying seven dollars for a plastic cup of vodka
Doesn't make a difference, doesn't make it wrong or right
You gotta stay this way forever, 'til it makes you want to die
You needed something out of nothing
