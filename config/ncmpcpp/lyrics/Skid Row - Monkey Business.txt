Outside my window there's a 
Whole lot of trouble coming
The cartoon killers and the rag cover clones

Stack heels kicking rhythm 
Of social circumcision
Can't close the closet on a shoe box full of bones (Come on!)

Kangaroo lady with her bourbon in a pouch
Can't afford the rental on a bamboo couch
Collecting back her favours 'cause her well is running dry
I know her act is terminal but she ain't going to die, no

Slim intoxicado drinking dime store hooch
Is always in a circle with his part-time pooch
Little creepy's playing dollies in the New York rain
Thinking Bowie's just a knife

Ooh the pain, I ain't seen the sun since I don't know when
The freaks come out at nine and it's twenty to ten
What's this funk that you call junk
To me it's just monkey business (Get back!)

Blind man in the box that will probably die
The village kids laugh as they walk by
A psycho is on the edge of this human garbage dump
And the vultures in the sewers are telling him to jump

Into the fire from the frying pan
Tripping on his tongue for a cool place to stand
Where's this shade that you've got it made
To me it's just monkey business

(Monkey business) Slipping on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back

(Monkey business) Slipping on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back

The Vaseline gypsies and silicone souls
Dressed to the society
Hypocrite heartbeat and cheap alibis
Can't get you by that monkey
Oh m-m-monkey, monkey

(Monkey business) Slipping on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back

(Monkey business) Slipping on the track
(Monkey business) Jungle in black
(Ain't your business) If I got no monkey on my back

(Monkey business) You can't tell me 
(Monkey business) I got the business
(Ain't your business) No monkey on my back, yeah, yeah, cool
Monkey business, ness, business
Don't get me no business, oh aay
