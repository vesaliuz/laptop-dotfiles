Go Go Muscle

Oh lightning flashes inside the ring
And lights up the flame warrior
Sparkle, kinniku beam, toward victory

I am clumsy (but believe that Iâ€²m strong)
Kinnikuman
Run and flip (amazingly fall)
Oh if there is no love in your heart
You are not a super hero now super hero
Kinnikuman go fight

Super wrestler who kicks ass with stormy killer moves
Bright red noses on the mat
Will blossom again tonight

I am clumsy (but believe that I'm strong)
Kinnikuman
Everybody is waiting
Oh, chase the endless dream
And become a super hero now super hero
Kinnikuman, go fight
