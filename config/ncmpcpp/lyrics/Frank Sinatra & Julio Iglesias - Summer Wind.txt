The summer wind came blowin' in
From across the sea
It lingered there to touch your hair
And walk with me

All summer long, we sang a song
And then we strolled that golden sand
Two sweethearts
And the summer wind

Like painted kites
Those days and nights they went flyin' by
The world was new
Beneath a blue umbrella sky

Then softer than a piper man
One day it called to you
I lost you, I lost you
To the summer wind

The autumn wind and the winter winds
They have come and gone
And still the days, those lonely days
They go on and on

And guess who sighs his lullabies
Through nights that never end
My fickle friend, the summer wind
The summer wind, warm summer wind, the summer wind
