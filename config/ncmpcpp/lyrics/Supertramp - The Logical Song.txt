When I was young
It seemed that life was so wonderful
A miracle
Oh, it was beautiful, magical

And all the birds in the trees
Well, they'd be singing so happily
Oh, joyfully
Oh, playfully watching me

But then they sent me away
To teach me how to be sensible
Logical
Oh, responsible, practical

And then they showed me a world
Where I could be so dependable
Oh, clinical
Oh, intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd
Please tell me who I am

I say, now watch what you say
Or they'll be calling you a radical
A liberal
Oh, fanatical, criminal

Oh, won't you sign up your name?
We'd like to feel you're acceptable
Respectable
Oh, presentable, a vegetable
Whoa
Take it, take it, take it, yeah

But at night when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please (Won't you tell me, won't you tell me what we've learned?)
Please tell me what we've learned? (Can you hear me? I know it sounds absurd)
I know it sounds absurd (Won't you help me? Tell me who I am)
But please tell me who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am, yeah

Woo!
Hey!
'Cause I'm feeling so logical
Hey!
D-d-d-d-d-d-d-digital
Yeah, one, two, three, five
Ooh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Ooh, it's getting unbelievable
Yeah
Ooh
