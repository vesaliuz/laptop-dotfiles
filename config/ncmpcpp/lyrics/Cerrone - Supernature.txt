Once upon a time
Science opened up the door
We would feed the hungry beasts
Till they couldn't eat no more

But the potions that we made
Touched the creatures down below
And they grew up in a way
That we'd never seen before

They were angry with the man
'Cause he changed their way of life
And they take their sweet revenge
As they trample through the night

For a hundred miles or more
You can hear the people cry
But there's nothing you can do
Even God is on their side

How can I explain
Things are different today
Darkness all around
And nobody makes a sound
Such a sad affair
No one seems to care

(Better watch out)
(Look at you now)
(Better watch out)
(Look at you now)

Supernature (watch out)
There's no way to stop it now
You can't escape
It's too late
Look what you've done
There's no place that you can run
The monster's made
We must pray

Supernature (better watch out)
Supernature (look at you now)
Supernature (better watch out)
Supernature (look at you now)

Better watch out
There's no way to stop it now
You can't escape
It's too late (supernature)
Look what you've done
There's no place that you can run
The monster's made
We must pray

Maybe nature has a plan
To control the way of man
He must start from scratch again
Many battles he must win

Till he earns his place on earth
Like the other creatures do
Will there be a happy end
Now that all depends on you
