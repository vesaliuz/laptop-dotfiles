Morning! Today's forecast calls for blue skies.

Sun is shinin' in the sky
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city on the streets
Where once was pity
Mister Blue Sky is living here today

Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?
Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration 
Mister Blue Sky's up there waitin' and today
Is the day we've waited for, ah

Oh, Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there, Mister Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Hey there, Mister Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around, see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Mister Blue Sky
Mister Blue Sky
Mister Blue Sky
Mister Blue Sky

Mister Blue, you did it right
But soon comes Mister Night
Creepin' over
Now his hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this
I'll remember you this way

Mister Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away for so long (So long)
Where did we go wrong?

Hey there, Mister Blue (Sky)
We're so pleased to be with you (Sky)
Look around see what you do (Blue)
Everybody smiles at you

Please turn me over
