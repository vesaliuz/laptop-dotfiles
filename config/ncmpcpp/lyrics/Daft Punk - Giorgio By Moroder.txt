When I was fifteen, sixteen when I started really to play the guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because the dream was so bigI didn't see any chance because I was living in a little town, I was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought "Well I may have a bit of a chance"
Because all I really wanted to do is music but not only play music
But compose music

At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques
So I would take my car, go to a discotheque, sing, maybe, thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for, about, almost two years
To survive
In the beginning
I wanted to do a album with the sounds of the '50s, the sounds of the '60s, of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said, "Wait a second?
I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer, which is the sound of the future."
And I didn't have any idea what to do, but I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the twenty-four track
Which was then synch to the moog modular
I knew that it could be a sound of the future, but I didn't realise how much impact it would be

My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio

You want to free your mind about a concept of harmony and of music being correct
You can do whatever you want
So nobody told me what to do
And there was no preconception of what to do
