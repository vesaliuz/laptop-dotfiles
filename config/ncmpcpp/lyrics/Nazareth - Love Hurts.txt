Love hurts, love scars
Love wounds and mars
Any heart, not tough
Or strong enough
To take a lot of pain
Take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know
But even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot
Really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not fooling me

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts

I know it isn't true
I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh love hurts
Ooh ooh...
