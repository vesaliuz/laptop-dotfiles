Go now, don't look back, we've drawn the line
Move on, it's no good to go back in time, no
I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings, it takes two
With fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Danger, in the game when the stakes are high
Branded, my heart was branded while my just senses stood by

I'll never find another girl like you
For happy endings it takes two
With fire and ice, a dream won't come true

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for
Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

(And Sara) loved me like no one's ever loved me before
(And Sara) hurt me, no one could ever hurt me more
(And Sara) Sara
(And Sara) nobody loved me anymore

I'll never find another girl like you, no
With fire and ice, and a dream, well, Sara
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewin' in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time for goodbyes

Sara, Sara
Storms are brewing in your eyes
Sara, Sara
No time is a good time
Sara, Sara

Sara, Sara
Why did it?
Why did it all fall apart?
Sara, Sara
Ooh, Sara
