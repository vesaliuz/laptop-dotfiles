Be happy
Come on let's go get it on!
Be happy
Be happy
Come on let's go get it on!
Be happy
Everybody let's go have some fun

I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
I'd rather stay here all the night with happy boys who sings
Come on let's go get it on, everybody let's go have some fun

I got a feeling you could use a little smile
Hoping it would stay there for just a little while
Making a lot of noise up there, throw your hands up in the air

I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
I'd rather stay here all the night with everyone who sings

Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
So happy, yeah!, so, so happy, yeah!

Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
Oh yeah, so happy!

Try with a giggle it will make you look so nice
And if you start to warm, you could further break the ice
Come on let's go get it on, everybody let's go have some fun

I've got a feeling you could use a little smile
Hoping it would stay there for just a little while
Making a lot of noise up there, throw your hands up in the air

I don't want to waste my time on simple little things
I'd rather stay here all the night with everyone who sings

Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
We are the happy boys and girls
Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
So happy, yeah!, so, so happy, yeah!

Happy boys and happy girls, we'll be
