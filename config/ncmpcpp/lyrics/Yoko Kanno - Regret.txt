[Carlos]
My heart goes out to you
When the winter snows give way to spring
My heart is longing now
Longing for the town where the happiness had been.

[Sebastien + Urs]
Been a place of hope and of dreaming too
Been a home when my heart always went back to you
[Sebastien + Urs + David]
But for now I only dream
Of the people who I loved and knew.

[Urs + Carlos]
Someone is singing I can hear singing now
Someone is weeping I can feel their tears
Someone is smiling showing me why and how to go on living for years and years

Flowers will bloom, yes they will yes they will
For you who are here or yet to be born.
They'll bloom, yes they will and they bloom again until
There's no missing sorrow and no reason left to mourn

[Carlos]
My heart goes out to you
[Sebastien]
Goes out to you
[Carlos]
When the morning sun lightsup the pale blue sky
[Urs]
The pale blue sky

[Carlos + Urs]
My heart is heavy now
With the grief I tried so often to deny

[Sebastien + Carlos]
I regret mistake that I sometimes made
But I know our love will never fade

[Sebastien]
And that you'll life on instead of me
[David]
Instead of me
[Sebastien]
And that you will have whatever love can be

[All]
Someone is thinking I can read ev'ry thought
Someone is shedding tears for all that was lost
Someone is leading you to love that they sought asking you to love all that you love the most

Flowers will bloom, yes they will yes they will
For you who are here or yet to be born.
They'll bloom, yes they will and they bloom again until
There's no missing sorrow and no reason left to mourn

[Carlos]
Flowers will bloom, yes they will yes they will
For you who are here or yet to be born.
They'll bloom, yes they will and they bloom again until
There's no missing sorrow and no reason left to mourn

[Carlos]
Yes they will
They'll bloom yes they will and they bloom again until...

[David]
You'll life and remember and love us forever more

[Carlos]
And love us forever more...
