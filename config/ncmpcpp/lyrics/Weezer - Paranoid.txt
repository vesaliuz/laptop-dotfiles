Finished with my woman, 'cause she couldn't help me
With my mind
People think I'm insane because I am frowning
All the time
All day long, I think of things, but nothing seems
To satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something
To pacify

Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh, yeah!

I need someone to show me the things in life
That I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh
And I will cry
Happiness, I cannot feel and love, to me
Is so unreal
And so, as you hear these words telling you now
Of my state
I tell you to enjoy life, I wish I could
But it's too late
