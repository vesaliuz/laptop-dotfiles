Baby, look at me
And tell me what do you see?
You ain't seen the best of me yet
Give me time, I'll make you forget
The rest

I've got more in me,
And you can set it free
I can catch the moon in my hand
Don't you know who I am?
Remember my name

Fame
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly high
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry

Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name

Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember

Baby, hold me tight,
'Cause you can make it right
You can shoot me straight to the top
Give me love and take all I got
To give

Baby, I'll be tough,
Too much is not enough,
No
I can ride your heart 'til it breaks
Ooh, I got what it takes

Fame
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly high
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry

Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my...

Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember

Fame
I'm gonna live forever
I'm gonna learn how to fly high
I feel it coming together
People will see me and cry

Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Baby, remember my name

Remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember, remember

Remember my name

Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Fame
I'm gonna learn how to fly high
I feel it coming together
Fame
People will see me and cry

Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
Fame
Light up the sky like a flame
Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Fame
Baby, remember my name

Fame
I'm gonna live forever
Fame
I'm gonna learn how to fly high
I feel it coming together
Fame
People will see me and cry
Fame
I'm gonna make it to heaven
