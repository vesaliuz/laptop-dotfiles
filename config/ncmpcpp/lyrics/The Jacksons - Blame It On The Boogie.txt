My baby's always dancing
It wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving, and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
At every kind of disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
My baby just can't take her eyes off me

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo

I just can't
I just can't 
I just can't control my feet
I just can't 
I just can't
I just can't control my feet

I just can't
I just can't 
I just can't control my feet
I just can't 
I just can't
I just can't control my feet

Sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

This magic music grooves me
That dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever
A fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance

Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

Don't you blame it sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, ow
