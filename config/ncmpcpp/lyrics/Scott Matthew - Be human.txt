I analyze and I verify and I quantify enough
One hundred percentile
No errors, no miss
I synchronize and I specialize and I classify so much
Don't worry 'bout dreaming
Because I don't sleep

I wish I could at least 30 percent
Maybe 50 for pleasure
Then skip all the rest

If I only was more human
I would count every single second the rest of my life
If I just could be more human
I'd have so many little babies and maybe a wife

I'd roll around the mud
And have lots of fun
Then when I was done
Build bubblebath towers and swim in the tub

Sand castles on the beach
Frolic in the sea
Get a broken knee
Be scared of the dark and I'd sing out of key

Cuss when I lost a fight
Kiss and reunite
Scratch a spider bite
Be happy with wrinkles I got when I smiled

Pet kittens till they purred
Maybe keep a bird
Always keep my word
I'd cry at sad movies
I'd laugh till it hurt

I'd buy a big bike
And ride by the lake
And I'd have lots of friends
And I'd stay out too late

If I could just be more human
I would see every little thing with a gleam in my eye
If only I was more human
I'd embrace every single feeling that came in my life

Would I care and be forgiving
Would I be sentimental and would I feel loneliness
Would I doubt and have misgivings
Would I cause someone sorrow, too
Would I know what to do
Will I cry when it's all over

When I die will I see heaven
