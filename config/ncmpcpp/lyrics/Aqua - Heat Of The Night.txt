In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
We dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
Let's dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

I've been waiting for summertime to come
Welcome beaches, lying in the sun
Music playing, people everywhere
No need to worry, the tequila is here
And when the sun goes down we are having fun,
'Cause there will be a party going on...

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
We dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
Let's dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Heat of the night.
Heat of the night.

Life is easy, on a holiday
Only problems seem so far away,
The bar is open, and everybody sings:
"Excuse me senorita, for you free drinks"
And when the sun goes down we are having fun,
'Cause there will be a party going on...

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
We dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
Let's dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Heat of the night.

'Cause when the sun goes down we are having fun,
And there will be a party going on...

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
In the heat of the night, night
We are having a fiesta,

"Let's swing it copa de dance!"
"Hola senorita, let's go to the beach."

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
Let's dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

In the heat of the night,
We are having a fiesta,
Let's dance until siesta,
When the sun comes alive.

Heat of the night.
Heat of the night.
